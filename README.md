# gifts-meditation
Small site for meditative aid. Nothing too fancy, mostly just the starter [Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/tutorials/?view=aspnetcore-7.0) template.

## Building & Contributing

Clone then `dotnet watch --project src`. Ezpz.

As for contributing - this is just a tiny side project so I don't anticipate receiving PRs. But here's some stuff that would be cool to have:
- gifts come from db table instead of hardcoded
- admin page to set/change gifts or other settings
- animation for the gift(s) appearing when button is clicked
